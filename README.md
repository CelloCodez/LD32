# LD32
Cheesy LD32 game.
To run, run game.bat.

My OS is Windows 7, and I know that Windows 8 doesn't always like BAT files. Sorry. First LD. Didn't like my game anyway once I coded it already, so I just quickly and lazily submitted it not liking the results. Maybe I should make a platformer next time?
